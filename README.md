# Interactive Morpheme Analyzer

An educational web application for learning morphology through interactive word analysis.

## Features

- **Visual Morpheme Breakdown**: Color-coded morphemes (roots in green, prefixes in blue, suffixes in red)
- **Educational Labels**: Shows whether morphemes are free/bound and inflectional/derivational
- **Interactive Interface**: Type any word and see it broken down instantly
- **Example Words**: Pre-loaded examples demonstrating different morphological structures
- **Comprehensive Explanations**: Each morpheme includes meaning and grammatical information

## What Students Learn

1. **Morpheme Types**: Understanding roots, prefixes, and suffixes
2. **Free vs. Bound Morphemes**: Identifying which morphemes can stand alone
3. **Inflectional vs. Derivational**: Distinguishing grammatical markers from word-forming affixes
4. **Word Structure**: How complex words are built from smaller meaningful units

## Technology

- **Next.js 14**: React framework for web applications
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform

## Educational Context

This project was created for **LX 250: Introduction to Linguistics** as an extra credit assignment to teach morphology concepts to future students.

### Key Concepts Demonstrated:

- **Morphemes**: The smallest meaningful units in language
- **Roots**: Core meaning-bearing morphemes (often free)
- **Affixes**: Bound morphemes that attach to roots (prefixes and suffixes)
- **Inflectional Morphology**: Grammatical modifications (e.g., -ed for past tense, -s for plural)
- **Derivational Morphology**: Word-formation processes that create new words or change part of speech

## Example Words Analyzed

- **unbreakable**: un- (prefix) + break (root) + -able (suffix)
- **rewriting**: re- (prefix) + write (root) + -ing (suffix)
- **happiness**: happy (root) + -ness (suffix)
- **teacher**: teach (root) + -er (suffix)
